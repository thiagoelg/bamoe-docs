|===

|Limitation | Description
|Form Generation: Issue in using Array field type| For Quarkus-based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, the forms can not currently display Array field types by default. For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1313[issue,window=_blank].
|Form Generation: Missing support for the form generation inputs | Currently the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* only allows as an input the json schemas generated in a kogito app, which means that, as a previous step we need a kogito app locally compiled. For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1315[issue,window=_blank].
|jBPM Quarkus Dev UI: Wrong behaviors on the Error notification in Start Process Form component | If we try to start a process instance in the `jbpm-quarkus-devui` and something goes wrong after submitting the form, it shows an error dialog providing some feedback to the user. For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1314[issue,window=_blank].

|Limitation | Description
|Container runs on port 80 | The container is configured to run the `httpd` service on port 80. This is an issue when deploying it to restrictive Kubernetes clusters (such as OpenShift) which restrict the usage of ports < 1024 except when made by a Service Account with elevated privileges (e.g. `anyuid` permission on OpenShift).
